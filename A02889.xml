            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OWER cauſes there were (right courteous Reader) which firſt moued me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate vnto thee (according to my ſmale capacity) the myſteries and Ceremonies of the holy Maſſe. The firſte was, the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dignitie, and moſt excellent ſublimitie, of this diuine and dreadfull ſacrifice: which althoughe it be ſuch, that neither the toung of man nor Angell, can worthylie magnifie as it deſerueth, yet the verie excellencie of the thing it ſelf inuiteth euerie one, with what praiſes he can, to ſet forth, extoll, and celebrate the ſame. The ſecond was, the moſt ſingular ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, reſpect, and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which the deuout &amp; Catholike people, of all places, of all ages, and
<pb facs="tcp:29031:3"/> of all callinges, the greateſt Doctors themſelues, and moſt learned deuines of all the worlde, Emperours, Kinges, Princes, and Commons, haue euer borne and caried to this Sacrifice: whoſe example it behoueth euerie good &amp; godlie man to follow The third was, the deep, mortall, and canckred mallice of w<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

The fourth was, the great and long want of a full and perfect expoſition, of this ſo diuine a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie in our English toung, by reaſon that none of our nation haue purpoſelie written of the ſame (for ought that euer I ſawe) theſe fortie yeares: which fower motyues, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto me, matter more then ſufficient, to explicate vnto thee, this vnexplicated ſecrett, and to vnfold vnto thee, a myſterie of ſuch

But tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the deadlie hatred and mallice of our aduerſaryes, or of their blaſphemyes, and other abuſes of this bleſſed ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I haue no whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, as hetherto, made anie mention of them: and would to God there were no cauſe at all, euer to defile our paper, with their execrable, enormous, and fylthie facts.

For ſome rushing violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie into the church, where the Prieſt was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating this vnbloodlie Sacrifice, ſtamping vnder their filthie feete the ſacred hoſt, and ſpilling vpon the ground the bleſſed bloud, vſed the conſecrated challice inſteed of a piſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot: and hauing compelled the Priest to drinck off the piſſe, next preſentlie hung him vp on high, faſtened and bound with cordes, vnto an image of Chriſt crucified, and then with manie shotts of their gunns and piſtolls, peirced quite through, both the Prieſt and the picture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by <hi>Lawnay</hi> in his <hi>Replique Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtien. lib. 2. cap. 16.</hi> Another ſeeing the Prieſt at Maſſe, to hold vp the ſacred hoſt to be adored of the people, tooke vp a dogg by the leggs, and held him ouer his head, shewing him vnto the people, in mockage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, of the Prieſt and his ſacrifice. <hi>Fox Act. and Mon. page. 1033.</hi> Another (as
<pb facs="tcp:29031:4"/> witneſſeth the ſame Fox) finding a Prieſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the bleſſed Sacrament to the people with great deuotion, offended to ſee them ſo deuoutlie and reuerentlie vpon their knees, preſentlie pulled out a whyniard or wood knife which he wore about him, and verie greuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wounded the Prieſt in diuers places, both of his head, arme, and hand, where with he held the challice, full of conſecrated hoſts, which were beſprinckled with the bloud of the Prieſt: nor would haue leſt him till he had killed him out right, if he had not bin preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the people preſent.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> But leaſt thou (gentle Reader) mayest think, that God who is the iuſt reuenger of all ſuch villanyes, hath permitted theſe men to eſcape vnpunished, let this example next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing ſatisfie thee, and ſerue for a warning to all the aduerſaryes and mallitious enemyes of the Maſſe. After that the holie Maſſe, was by publike proclamation of the late Queene, commanded to ſurceaſe in all places of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, by Midſomer day immediatlie follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, fower men of Douer in the countie of Ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:29031:5"/> (beſides others which aſiſted at the ſame actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) went into the church of the ſame towne, and tooke forth the Copes, Veſtments, and other Prieſtlie Ornaments belonging therto, geuing forth and boaſtinge abroad, that they would goe fetch the Pope from Canterburie. And the verie next day after Midſomer day; theſe companyons came to Canterburie; put on the ſaid Copes and other Ornaments vpon their backs, and in a Pix (made to reſerue the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament of the bodie of our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus) they put a doggs turd; and then beginning at S. Georges gate, roade in forme of proceſsion quite thorough the City, till they came to weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate: which done, the verie ſame night they poſted back againe to Douer. One of theſe fower, was Captaine Roberts, who preſentlie after, carryed all the Copes, Vestments, and other ornaments, ouer the ſeas to Dunkirk where he ſold them. His miſerable and wretched end was, that there leaping out of one ſmale boate into another, to get to his Shipp, the boate he was in ſlipping away, he ſtepped short of the other, and ſoe falling into the water, pitched

The third, dyed of Iohn Caluins diſeaſe, that is to ſay, he was eaten vp with lice, being yet aliue. The fourth (who afterwards became Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Maidſtone) falling greuouſlie ſick indured Gods terrible iudgments: for he ſtunck ſoe abhominablie, that none (no not his owne wife) could endure to come neare him, ſo that when they gaue him meat to eate, they were forced to put it vppon the ende of a pole, and ſo to reach it vnto him thorough a windowe. For confirmation wherof, there are right credible and worshipfull perſons yet aliue, who can teſtifie the ſame.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and ſay the ſame, that touching the affaires of Religion, we finde no greater enimies and mocquers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and principallie of the religious ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and Ceremonies belonging to the ſame, then thoſe who are moſt of all ignorant of their ſenſe and meaning. And wheras we ſee in this our curſed and execrable age, a great number of
<pb facs="tcp:29031:10"/> Chriſtians ſo eaſilie contemne, and ſo impudentlie mock at ſuch godlie Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; ſo if they rightlie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the reaſon of them, they would certainlie receiue them with ſingular deuotion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou therfore, gentle Reader, I pray thee vnderſtand, that amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt all the fiue ſences of nature which God hath giuen vs, two eſpeciallie (to wit, our Eares, and our Eies) are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie called. <hi>Senſus doctrinae, aut diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinae.</hi> Senſes of doctrine, or diſcipline: that is to ſay, whereby we are made capable, to receiue inſtructions and diſcipline; For without theſe two, it is impoſſible euer to learne anie thinge, and by the meanes of theſe two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſenſes, we come to vnderſtand and learne, all maner of ſciences. All the Ceremonies therfore of the Maſſe, are inſtituted by the Church princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to inſtruct the people by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of ſeeing. And euen as they who
<pb facs="tcp:29031:10"/> would take away preaching out of the Church, doe as much as if they should ſtop vp the peoples eares: euen ſo they who would take away the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies out of the Church, doe as much as in them lyeth, to hide, or cleane put out, the peoples eies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What then may we thinke or ſay, of the pernicious practiſes of the Arch-heretiques of our age? Yea, and how iuſt occaſion haue thoſe which are of their owne religion (as well as we) to crye out againſt them? For firſt theſe malicious Maſters, haue quite caſſierd a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of godlie Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, from amongſt the Chriſtian people, in all citties and countries wherſoeuer they haue liued. And next, euen of thoſe few which ſtill they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, they as vtterlie depriue them of their ſenſe and meaning, as if there were not ſo much as any one vſed, in all their religion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But what ſuppoſe you to be, the
<pb facs="tcp:29031:11"/> drift and legierdemain of theſe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers? Forſooth, becauſe knowing full well, that in our Catholique Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, there are comprehended and lye hid, ſo manie notable myſteries, they plainlie foreſee, that if they should trulie explicat and manifeſt vnto the people, the ſenſe and meaning of ſome of their owne, they should preſentlie giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a light, and inflame their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes with the loue of ours. For which cauſe (as by a ſubtle and craftie deuiſe) they for the moſt part, ether conceale them from them, or ſpeake in conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt and hatred of them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To make this point the more apparent; Of how manie thouſandes of them may you aſke theſe queſtions, before you ſhall meete with one that can make you anſwere? For example, aske them. Why, to the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their common ſeruice, the Clark and Miniſter muſt be clad in white, rather then in black, blew, or
<pb facs="tcp:29031:11"/> yeallow, or in a coate, or garment of any other colour? Aske them, why in ſaying the ſame ſeruice, the leſſon, is read out of the ould teſtament, and and not out of the new? and why not all ſcripture out of the ould, or al out of the new? Aske them why the ould teſtament is read before the new: and why not the newe before the ould, ſeeing it is of farr greater dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as them ſelues do freely confeſſe? Aske them, why they kneele at the ſaying of the Lordes prayer, and riſe vp at the Creede; rather then riſe vp at the Lordes prayer, and kneele downe at the Creede? Aske them, why they ſet the Font neere the Church doore, and the Communion table within the Chancel: and why not as well the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> table at the Church doore, &amp; the Font within the Chancell? Aſke them why they command me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat often, and to be Baptiſed but once; &amp; why not to be Baptiſed often
<pb facs="tcp:29031:12"/> and to Comunicat but once; eſpecially if (as ſectaries ſay) they be but ſeales? I omit for breuitie ſake, the churching of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The marrying with a ringe. God fathers and God mothers in the Sacrament of Baptiſme. The confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp;c. Al which, with a hundred more which I might name, the Proteſtant Cleargy do ſtill retaine, wherof the people no more vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning, then the man in the Moone.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Now therfore, for as much as all Ceremonies (vſed for the better, &amp; more ſolemne ſettinge foorth of the deuine ſeruice) are of one of theſe two ſortes, that is to ſay, ether Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue, or Significatiue, it followeth, that to weare a white Surpleſſe, rather then a black; or to reade for the firſte Leſſon, rather part of the ould Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the new: or to ſet the Fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the Church doore, rather then within the Chancell (or in the bottom of the
<pb facs="tcp:29031:12"/> belfrie) are nothinge, Commoditatiue, nether to the Prieſt, nor yet to the people; ergo they are Significatiue, that is to ſay, ſignifying ſome ſpeciall myſterie, wherin the Chriſtian people ought to be inſtructed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The holie Ceremonies therfore of our Religion, if they were explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto thee, gentle Reader (if thou be a Proteſtant) as they are vnto Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, they would aſſuredlie yeald thee, moſt ſingular comfort; wherein I will report me to thyne owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, after thou shalt haue firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, the explication onlie of theſe which appertaine to the Maſſe (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou haſt here ſet downe, euerie word, ſentence, and ſillable that is in the ſame.)

            <p>Firſt therefore it is very probable, that the word <hi>Miſſa,</hi> Maſſe: is neither Greek nor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, but Hebrew, the Apoſtles who were of the Hebrew Nation, hauing promulgated the ſame in that language, and named it <hi>Miſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> drawne and taken of this Hebrew word, <hi>Mas,</hi> which ſignifieth Oblation, Tax, or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute; as is manifeſtly to be gathered, out of Deut. 16. and 20. and 3 Reg. 8. and Eſay 13. And in many places of holy Scripture, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the Sacrifices, and Oblations, of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29031:14"/> old Lawe, as of Lambs, Oxen, Tuttles, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and the like, Num. 6. Iudg. 6. Ezech. 45. &amp;c. For which cauſe the Catholique Church, doth moſt willinglie retaine this name, as finding none other more conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and proper, to ſignify this moſt excellent Oblation and Sacrifice, which repreſenteth that other, which was the Tax or Tribute, paid by Ieſus Chriſt, vnto God his Father, for the price and ranſome of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others wil haue it to be of the Latin word, <hi>Miſſa, ſent,</hi> becauſe in the Maſſe, principally we ſend vp our prayers &amp; oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to almightie God. Hugo Vict. l. 2. de Sacram. p. 9. cap. 14. which ſome explicat in this manner: that this Hoſt was firſt ſent by God the Father, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſent vs his only Sonne, to be in carnate, &amp; to take flesh in the wombe of the B. Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and afterwards to offer vp that bloody Sacrifice vppon the Altar of the Croſſe, for our Redemption; in remembrance whereof this Sacrifice is celebrated, and is by vs againe ſent and preſented to the eternall Father, for as much as we dayly offer it vp to his deuine. Maieſty. Innocen. 3. lib. 3. de Sacrificio miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae cap 12. et Bon: op. de miſterio Miſſae.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Againe, others thinke it to be ſo called of diſmiſſinge the people; and ſo to ſignifie the the ſame that <hi>Miſſio,</hi> which ſignifieth, a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

As in the like caſe and difficulty, S.

            <p>THE holy and dreadfull Sacrifice of the Maſſe, hath two eſſentiall or principall parts· The one is, Conſecration: the other is, the Receauing of the Prieſt. Tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching theſe two principall and eſſentiall parts

In which reſpect, he ſaid vnto his diſciples: <hi>Yet many things I haue to ſay to you, but you can not beare them now: but when he, the Spirit of truth commeth, he shall teach you all truth: and the things that are to come, he shall shew you.

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. Hence therfore it is, that we affirme and ſay with very good reaſon, the holy Maſſe to haue bin inſtituted and ordained by our Lord himſelfe, for as much as he inſtituted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the moſt eſſentiall and principall parts thereof, to wit, Conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Receiuing, referring the cerimonies and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to the care and diſcretion of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and their ſucceſſors: who in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe haue taken ſuch order, as might beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his death and paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into our memories, according to that which he comaunded, that ſo oft as they should do it, they should do it in remembrance of him; But of all this, we shall ſpeake hereafter more at large.</p>

            <p>THIS Sacrifice being ſo excellent a thing, as hath before bin shewed, it was conuenient that the duine Maieſty of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, should ordaine in his Church, an order of men, which should be aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who should both conſecrate, and offer the ſame: which thing he performed in his laſt ſupper, inſtituting the order of Prieſt hood, vnto which he gaue power and authority to conſecrate, receiue, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to others, his moſt pretious Body and Blood, hidden vnder the formes of bread and wine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By which, it is moſt manifeſt, that the Maſſe, is a worke, the moſt great, the moſt worthy, and moſt excellent, that poſſiblie a man can vndertake or enterpriſe, ſeing the Prieſt who ſaith it, excelleth in dignitie all the Kings, Emperours, and Prieſts, either of the written law or of the law, of nature: and furthermore he ſurpaſſeth in this power, the Patriarks, the Prophets, yea and the Angells themſelues, who neither can conſecrate, receiue, nor diſtribute to others, the Bodie of our Bleſſed Sauiour: whereas the Prieſt hauinge conſecrated it, houldeth it in his hands, receaueth it, keepeth it, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it to others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Rightlie therefore do we ſaie, that this noble dignitie of Prieſthood, can with no
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29031:18"/> pomp, eloquencie, or ornament of words, be ſufficientlie extolled. For it ſurmounteth and ſurpaſſeth the tongues of the moſt ſubtle Philoſophers, yea the top and heigth of all excellencie of euerie creature. If you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to the glorie of Kings, or to the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of Princes diadeams, theie are as far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inferiour thereto, as if we should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the baſeſt lead, to the pureſt and fineſt gould.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But what need I ſtand vpon earthlie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, when the caeleſtiall cittizens, the Angels themſelues dare not aſpire to Prieſtlie aucthoritie. For to which of the Angels hath God at anie time ſaid? <hi>whoſe ſinnes you shall forgiue, they are forgiuen them: and whoſe you ſhal retaine, they are retained, Io. 20.</hi> yea which is much more: <hi>Doe this for the commemoration of me. Cor. 11.24.</hi> In a word, theie admire, and tremble to behould, that which the Prieſt maie bouldlie touch, handle, and deuide in pieces, as being warranted by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But to paſſe yet farther from the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of Angels, and to come to the Ladie of Angells, and Queene of all the world, euen shee I ſaie, albeit shee farre ſurpaſſed all creatures in the plenitude and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of heauenlie grace, yet euen shee hir ſelfe, alſo giueth place to the orders and Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchies

For hauing all other honor, giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto her by her Sonne in the higheſt degree, yet shee atained not to this dignitie of conſecrating or offering this dreadfull Sacrifice. True it is that shee in pronouncing eight humble words; <hi>Ecce ancil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la. &amp;c.</hi> once onlie, corporallie conceiued the Sonne of God, the Sauiour and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of all the world. But Prieſts as his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are dailie the cauſe that the ſelfe ſame Sonne of God, and of the Virgin, is trulie and reallie preſent in the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The high King of Heauen, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate in our Bleſſed Ladie, shee brought forth to the world, a Sauiour, mortall and paſſible: the Prieſts offer to God, and giue to men, the verie ſame Sauiour, now impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible &amp; moſt glorious. Shee gaue ſuck to the new borne Babe, with hir virginall breaſts, handled him with hir hands, bare him in hir arms, &amp; performed ſuch other ſeruiceable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Chriſts little me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers: theiſe Prieſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him with their mouths, carrie him, &amp; giue him in meate to others; who is the bread and food of Angels. O venerable ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie of holie hands! O high and happie dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie! O great and onlie wonder of the world!</p>
            <p n="6">6. Nor are anie of theſe compariſons either

For as in all rigor of ſpeech, it muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be confeſſed, that God is far aboue his creatures, the ſoule much more noble then the bodie, and ſpirituall things more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t then temporall: ſo in all rigour of ſpeech, it muſt needs be granted, Prieſtlie dignitie to be the higheſt dignity, and degree of this life, for as much as it is immediatlie excerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the honour of God, and adminiſtration of deuine and ſpirituall affaires: wheras the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of Princes (though in their rancke, moſt to be reſpected) yet their functions &amp; affaires, are chieflie touchinge temporall thinges.</p>

            <p>THE end for which Maſſe is to be ſaid or heard, is moſt high and excellent: yea ſo high, that a higher or greater cannot po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſiblie be inuented or imagined. The chiefe and principall end, is onlie one: the other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29031:19"/> are diuers. The firſt is the honour of God, who being the laſt and finall end af all things, of good right willeth and ordaineth, that all things, be done and referred, to his honour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The beter to vnderſtand this point, it is to be noted, that Sacrifice is, an act of worship, adoration, or honour, the which is due onlie to God, with paine of death to all thoſe who shall attribute the ſame to anie other. <hi>Sacrificans Dijs eradicabitur, niſi Domino ſoli. Exod. 22.</hi> He that shall ſacrifice to Gods but onlie to our Lord, shalbe rooted out. The Maſſe therfore is, and ought to be both ſaid and heard, chieflie to honour God, by, and with ſoe diuine a Sacrifice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The other ends, are diuers, for the which the ſame maie either be ſaid, or heard. As for the preſeruation of the vniuerſall church: the propagation of the Catholike Religion: for the Popes holines: for Bishops Paſtors, and religious Perſons: for peace, and concord amongſt Chriſtian Princes, for our parents: friends, and benefactors: for thankſgiuing to God for all his benefits: for the preſeruation of the fruits of the earth, &amp; for our te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall ſubſtance, and generally for all manner of neceſſities, either of ſoule or body.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In ſaying of Maſſe, there is required of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29031:20"/> the Prieſts part, a ſinguler attention and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion: be it either in regard of the thinge that is offered, or in regard of him to whom the ſame is offered, which is almighty God himſelfe, who is. <hi>Rex egum, &amp; Do minus Do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantium.

How pure and cleane, ought that ſoule to be, that doth re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue ſo worthy a Lord? Thus S. Chriſoſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For further proofe and confirmation hereof, the holy Scripture recounteth a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full example, of the two children of Helie the Prieſt, who were punished by death, for that they did not performe the office of Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthood,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29031:20"/> duly as they ought: what then may we thinke, shall be the punishment of ſuch Prieſts, as should now approach vnworthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Altar of our Lord?</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is written of S.

            <p n="8">8. And it is teſtified of the glorious Father S.

            <p>FOR as much as vpon all feſtiuall daies, a man muſt either ſaie Maſſe, or at the leaſt heare Maſſe, by the expreſſe comande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, it is great reaſon, that this worke, should be well and orderlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, according as is conuenient, and as the weight and importance of the thing it ſelfe requireth.</p>
            <p>Firſt then we muſt procure to haue <hi>an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and inflamed deſire to heare the ſame with fruit,</hi> and with the greateſt attention, that poſſibly we may: which deſire ought to be accompanied, with <hi>a liuely faith, of the preſence of Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our Sauiour, who with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding loue, vouchſafeth to come to viſite vs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondlie, it will help verie much, to thinke vpon <hi>the wonderfull greatnes and dignity of this moſt holy Sacrifice,</hi> whereof I haue ſpoken a litle before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, to remember <hi>our owne vilenes &amp; abiectnes,</hi> reputing our ſelues moſt vnworthy, to be preſent at ſo excellent and deuine a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, in the preſence whereof, the verie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

            <p>THE fruites which a man may gather by hearing of Maſſe are great, and many in number.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is, that a man is <hi>admitted vnto the inward familiarity of our Lord Ieſus Christ,</hi> and to be neare to his perſon, as his ſecretarie, or chamberlaine, where he both heareth and ſeeth, ſo manie deuine ſecrets: which places and roomes in the courts of earthlie Princes, are ſo much ſought after, euen by the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt Lords and Nobles of this world, and are ſo highly eſteemed, that oftentimes theie are content to ſerue their whole life for them, without anie recompence at all in the end whereas our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the King of Heauen and earth, doth neuer (vnles he be forſaken) forſake him who hath done him ſeruice, nor leaueth him without reward and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29031:23"/> recompence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, he who is preſent at Maſſe, doth participate ſo much the more of this deuine Sacrifice, foraſmuch as in the ſame, more <hi>particuler praier is made for him,</hi> then for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Prieſt ſaying. <hi>Er pro omnibus circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantibus.</hi> And for all that are ſtanding about. He Profiteth also more by the attention and deuotion, cauſed by the reall preſence of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the ſunne doth more heate the cuntries neare vnto it, then thoſe that are further from it: and the fire doth more warme thoſe that approach vnto it, then thoſe that ſtand a far off from it. And hence it was, that the Apoſtles receiued ſo manie graces and priuiledges, becauſe they were continually in the preſence of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. S. Chriſoſtome alſo ſaith, that grace is infuſed into ſundrie perſons, in the preſence of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdlie, in hearing of Maſſe deuoutlie, we receiue <hi>pardon of our veniall ſinnes,</hi> and obtaine remiſſion (at the leaſt in Part) of the temporall paine, which remaineth after the fault or guilt of our ſinnes is forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, and for the which a man is to endure, either in this life, or in purgatory: which is truelie a moſt wonderfull benefit, ſeinge that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie leaſt paine in Purgatorie, is greater then all the paines, of this world togither.

            <head>Of the faults and abuſes, which may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted im hearing of Maſſe. CHAP. <hi>6.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FIRST it were an intollerable abuſe, if anie (which God forbid) should goe to Maſſe to <hi>content their eies with wanton and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt ſight,</hi> making the Church a shop of their diſordinate appetites, not hauing anie reſpect, either to the preſence of God, or of his Angels, nor to his deuine ſeruice, nor to the time, in which is repreſented the greateſt benefit that our Lord hath done for man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond abuſe were <hi>to heare Maſſe onlye for fashion,</hi> and much more to ſpend the time in idle talke: without anie atention or deuotion, for this were not onlie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part without fruit, but to looſe much by that, they might gaine exceedinglie. For euen as you paie not, but thoſe who labour in your vineyeard (not thoſe who goe thither to ſee and behould it) euen ſo our Lord doth not giue his hyre, but to thoſe who are attentiue to the work of his deuine ſeruice. yea eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holie &amp; feſtiuall daies, ſuch perſons should ſinne moſt grieuiouſlie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third abuſe, were <hi>to be preſent with ſuch diſtraction, and vagation of ſpirit,</hi> that in ſteed of thinking vpon the holie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29031:25"/> of the Maſſe, one should call to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de his worldlie buſines, bethinking him ſelfe of the meanes wherwith he should haue proſecuted ſome negotiations, which ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came not to ſo good effect and iſſue, as he deſired: and diſcourſing of the circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he muſt vſe for the time to come in ſome other buſines which he hath yet to doe, and ſo as we may ſay, build caſtles in the ayre. Surelie the ſpindle, or wheele of a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, doth not turne ſo much as doth the ſpirit of ſuch a man, being preſent at Maſſe, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him ſelfe to be carried without bridle, whether ſoeuer his wandring fancie shall pleaſe to moue, or to tranſport him. And of theſe I ſay as of the former, that they should offend in the ſame degree, and looſe the fruit and merit, which they might reape by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Maſſe deuoutlie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Fourth abuſe were, to ſeek for the shorteſt Maſſes, and to think the time long that we are preſent at this diuine ſacrifice. For ſurelie this sheweth, that our minds are more ſet vpon earthlie, then heauenlie things, ſince that we find no ſuch yrkſomneſſe in corporal bankets, playes, or other vayn ſights. But we should rather conſider, how our B. Sauiour thought not the time of three houres long to hang vpon the croſſe for our ſakes: in which reſpect their deuotion is very commendable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:29031:26"/> who vſe to heare more maſſes then one euery day, according as their other neceſſarie buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will permitte them. Yea if the fire of the loue of God were perfectlie enkindled in our hartes, all the while that the Maſſe should laſt, would ſurely ſeeme vnto vs verie short and litle: like as the Scripture ſaith of Iacob, that he ſerued the ſpace of 14. yeares to haue Rachael in mariage, and that he eſteemed all thoſe yeares but as a few dayes, in reſpect of the loue he bare vnto hir.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Fifthe abuſe were, to be ouer cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in adorning our ſelues, when we goe to Church, and in this women, eſpeciallie of young yeares &amp; good calling, muſt be more wary, becauſe they may otherwiſe, not onlie hinder their owne deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that of others alſo. It is ſtrange what caueats S. Paul and the holie fathers giue them in this kind. And ſurelie when they goe to Church, they should rather ſeeke to pleaſe God then men. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they eaſilie excuſe themſelues, if they doe otherwiſe. To conclude, when we repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to the temple of God to pray, we ought to lay away all toyes and vanities, which anie waye may hinder our deuotions, and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie recollect our ſpirits, and driue away all diſtractions, that we may without anie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation, freelie lift vp our hartes to God, &amp; deuoutly employ the time, in holie, pious,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29031:26"/> and holeſome meditations, according as shall hereafter be declared. And now to ſpeake of the Altar it ſelfe.</p>

            <p n="2">2. And what elſe may be expected in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable repreſentation, of the death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Sauiour Ieſus, but that our holie mother the Catholique church, should firſt plant in the fore-front of this excellent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, the triumphant banner, and moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious ſtandard of the Croſſe, the badge &amp; liuerie of hir celeſtiall ſpouſe, the enſigne of heauen, the conſolation of earth, the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

            <p n="3">3. For this holie ſigne, is the tree of life, planted in the mideſt of paradiſe. It is the wood of the Arke, which ſaued Noe and his family, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drowning. It is the ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, which Abraham bore, when he went to deliuer his brother Loth, from the captiuitie of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. It is the woode, which Iſaac his ſonne, carried vpon his shoulders to the place of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. It is the ladder, wheron Iacob ſaw the Angels deſcend, and aſcend, vp to heauen. It is the key of paradiſe, which openeth and no man shuteth, and shuteth and no man open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. It is the braſen ſerpent, which healethe thoſe that are ſtrooken, with the venemous ſting of the diuel. It is the rodde of Moyſes, wher with he cauſed the ſtonie rock, to yelde foorth ſtreames of refreshing waters. It is the woode, which being caſt by our true Elizeus, into the waters that were bitter, made them moſt ſweete and pleaſaunt of taſt. It is the ſtone, where with Dauid ſtrooke Golias on the forehead and preſently ſlew him. And it is the letter <hi>Thau,</hi> marked on the foreheades of all the faithfull, which keepeth and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them from all kind of danger.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In a word, no mortall tongue is able ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie to expreſſe the wonderful vertues of this ſigne. For it is the ſtaffe of the lame, the

It is the ſonge of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, the preaching of the Apoſtles, the glorie of Martyres, the conſolation of Confeſſors, the ioy of Prieſtes, and the sheilde of Princes. It is the foundation of the Church, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Sacraments, the ſubuerſion of Id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olatrie, the death of hereſie, the diſtruction of the proud, the bridle of the rich, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked, the torment of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the glorie of the ſaued.</p>
            <p>No maruel then, that the Catholique chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rche, hath ſo highlie honoured this heauenlie ſigne, as to plant it, and ſeate it, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and firſt place of this holie ſacrifice, &amp; to adorne and beautifie there with, this heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>To make the ſame more manifeſt vnto you, take an example of ſome great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon, who for ſome hainous fact, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing iuſtly incurred the diſpleaſure of his Prince, is depriued of his honors, banished his court, excluded from his preſence, and from the companie and ſocietie of all his Nobles, how would not ſuch an one deplore his fall, and labour to be reſtored into his princes fauour?

               <p>THE Firſt prayers, which the prieſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp to God in the Maſſe, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie called by the name of <hi>Collects,</hi> which is a word borrowed of the Latins, as the learned doe verie well knowe, and ſignifieth, a gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or collection: which as it may be made of diuers and ſundrie thinges, ſo hath it ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie ſignifications.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Somtimes it ſignifieth a collection which is made, of tributes and duties, to be paid to the Prince: whereof it cometh, that the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers thereof, are called Collectors.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Both the holie Scripture, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, doe vſe this word Collect, to ſignifie an aſſemblie of the people of God,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:29031:81"/> and yet not euerie manner of aſſemblie, but onlie of ſuch, as are great and ſolemne, as Leuit. 23. <hi>Dies enim coetus est atque collectae.</hi> For it is a day of meetinge and aſſemblie. And in Deut. 16. <hi>Quia collecta eſt Domini Dei tui.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the aſſemblie of thy Lord God.

               <p n="4">4. So that by this which hath bene alredie ſayed, it is not hard to vnderſtand, why the firſt prayers in the Maſſe, are called Collects: the which Durandus in his fourth booke and 15. cap. explicateth ſaying. <hi>Collects properlie are prayers, which are ſo called, for that they are ſayed vpon the people aſſembled.</hi>

               <p>The matter it ſelfe, and ſubiect of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectes, is commonly taken out of the holie Scriptures. As for example, that of the three children, the which is recited verie often, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29031:82"/> namely in the Maſſes of all the Saturdaies, of the four times of the yeare, and is taken out of the 3. chapter of the prophet Daniel; which Collect, beginneth as followeth. <hi>Deus qui tribus pueris &amp;c. O God, which to the three children, didſt mitigate the flames of fyre: graunt mercifully, that we thy ſeruants, be not burned with the flames of our vices</hi> &amp;c. Where you ſee, that this Collect is founded, vpon that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull miracle, which our Lord wrought, in aſſawaging the flames of the fiery fornace, in the fauour and conſeruation, of thoſe his fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thfull ſeruantes, by occaſion whereof, wee beſeeche our Lord, to aſſawage in vs, the flames of our vices, and ſinfull concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcences.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe that of Sexageſima Sunday, is in a manner the ſame: wherein the Church, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth occaſion to praye vnto God, that he would deliuer vs from all aduerſitie, by the helpe and protection, of bleſſed Saint Paul, whom he gratiouſlie preſerued, from ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perilles, ſaying. <hi>Deus qui conſpicis</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O God who ſeest, that we doe in no wiſe, put our truſt in our owne actions: graunt mercifullie, that by the protection of the doctor of the Gentils, we may be defended against all aduerſities. Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Somtimes they are taken, out of the liues and examples of the holie Saintes, whoſe feaſts are celebrated. As that on the

               <head>Three ſimboles, or Creedes, in the Catholique Church.</head>
               <p>In the Catholike Church, we haue three Symbolls or Creeds. The firſt is, that of the Apoſtles, which all good Chriſtians ought to learne by hart, and to ſay it, both mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening, for it chaſeth away the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells, who lye in wayte, both day and night, to deuoure vs. The ſecond is, that of the councell of Nice, which is vſuallie ſayd in the Maſſe, after the goſpell. And the third is, that of S. Athanaſius, which is ſung at Prime vpon all Sundayes. Both which latter, are no additions to the former, but expoſitions, or more playne declarations thereof. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Church admitted theſe two Creedes, beſides that of the Apoſtles, was, for that the Heretickes, receiuing the firſt according to the wordes, or letter, did not receiue it according to the ſenſe, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Catholike Church, And for that alſo the Arrians, and other Heretickes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued the ſame ſoe confuſedlie, that it was hard to diſcerne the Catholikes, from the Heretikes any waye by the ſame. In which caſe, the Church was conſtrayned to putt to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29031:103"/> her helping hand, adding the two latter as an expoſition, or playner declaration of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and hath euer ſince, ſerued to ſingular good purpoſe, for the conuiction of ſeuerall hereſies and heretickes, which haue ſprung vp in ſundry times, and vpon ſundrie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
               <p>The Symbole of the concel of Nice, was compoſed vnder Pope Silueſter. Plat? <hi>in vita Silueſtri,</hi> in the preſence of the great and moſt religious Emperour Conſtantine, by 318. Byshops aſſembled from all partes of the world, and kept at his expences: whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie had their right eyes put out, and their right hands cutt of for the defence of the fayth, and Chriſtian religion, in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent perſecutions, as teſtifieth Nicephorus lib. 8. cap. 1. He honored them with preſents condigne to their eſtates, and royallie fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted them at his table, cauſing the principall of them, to ſett cloſe vnto himſelfe, before he would licence them to depart to their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: kiſſing alſo their wounds, when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed them. <hi>Naucler, vol: 2. gener: 11.</hi>

Wherupon it happened, that certaine shepheardes ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it for recreation, and laying bread vpon a ſtone, at the prolation of the ſacred wordes, the bread was turned into flesh, but they by Gods iuſtice, were ſtriken with fyre ſent downe from heauen. For Which cauſe the

               <p>The like alſo happened to three litle boyes, who to make them ſelues ſport, would ſeeme to take vpon them to ſing Maſſe. Who firſt placeing a ſtone inſteed of an Altar, and then laying their bread theron, inſteed of an Hoſt, and after putting water into a wodden dishe, inſteed of a Chalice, were ſoddainlie ſtroken to the earth, and their bread and water, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with fyre which fell from heauen: and for the ſpace of three dayes (to the great amazement of their parents) remayned ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chles. And after three dayes, coming againe vnto them ſelues, recounted openlie, all that, which had befell them: al which is teſtified more at lardge, by <hi>Ioannes Moſcus,</hi> and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie others.</p>
               <p>The premiſſes therfore conſidered, I am here to pray the gentle Reader to pardon me, if I doe not turne the wordes of the ſacred Canon, immediatlie enſuing, into our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue, as I haue done the former, which I proteſt in regard of their dreadfull venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes, I dare not to doe.

Or as Cyrillus ſayeth, a thinge which is giuen to ſuch as are in neede. <hi>Cyril. in Collect.</hi> 2. They are called <hi>Munera,</hi> in as much as they are receiued of vs with a gratefull minde.

               <p>The 1. reaſon why before the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bodie of Chriſt, the Church hath ordained the commemoration of the Saints to be made, is, becauſe she hath bene tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght and learned this out of the figures of the ould teſtament. For as the legal prieſt and Bishop, entering into the holie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, brought in with him the names of the twelue tribes, written vpon his Rational: euen ſo the euangelicall prieſt, entring into the holie of holies, bringeth in with him the names of the twelue Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>But beſides this, there are ſundrie other reaſons, for the commemoration, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the B. Saints. 1. Becauſe the odor and fame of their vertues, is euerie
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:29031:156"/> where diſperſed thoroughout the world. 2. Becauſe their holie bodies and reliques, are had in high veneration, and viſited and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented with manie pious pilgrimages. 3.

Becauſe vpon the tombes of Martyrs, and reliques, and bodies of the B. Saints, the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, is daylie celebrated, 5. Becauſe at the ſepulchres, and memories of the B. Saintes, God doth worke manie maruelous miracles. 6.

            <p>THE Prieſt hauing put the third part of the Hoſt into the Chalice, as before we haue declared, next hee couereth

And therfore Agnus Dei is ſaid, the Chalice being couered: becauſe Chriſt appeared to his Apoſtles the doores being shut, and gaue them powre and authoritie to remit ſinnes.</p>
            <p>As touching the woord it ſelfe, <hi>Agnon</hi> in Greeke, ſignifieth as much as gentle or meek in English. And Chriſt is here called a Lamb, becauſe a Lambe hurteth nothing, nether man nor beaſt.</p>
            <p>Againe Agnus is called <hi>ab Agnoſcendo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe amongſt a great flock and multitude by his only crye &amp; bleating, he is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his mother. And euen ſo Chriſt the Lambe of God, hanging vpon the Croſſe, by his voice and cry, was acknowledged by his mother.</p>

               <p>This Agnus Dei is ſaid or recited the third time: becauſe this La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be of God not onlie was acknowledged of others, but alſo him ſelfe acknowledged others, namelie, his heauenlie Father: his bleſſed mother: and alſo vs. He acknowledged his Father when he ſaid. <hi>Father into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.</hi> He ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledged his mother, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid. <hi>Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould thy ſonne.</hi> And he acknowledged vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid. <hi>Father forgiue them they knowe not what they doe.</hi> So that <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> thrice repeated, is as much to ſay, as.

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:29031:214"/> peace, to wit, betwixt God and man: Of man in him ſelfe: and betwixt man and man. For firſt he brake the peace betwixt God and man, when he ſeduced our firſt parents to tranſgres the commandement of almightie God.

Thirdlie, he brake the peace betwixt man and man, when thorough malice he incited one brother to murther the other.

               <head>Why we aske mercie &amp; peace for the liuing, and repoſe or reſt for the departed.</head>
               <p>The reaſon why we demaund mercie and peace for the liuinge, and repoſe or reſt for the departed, is to ſignifie the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place of forgiuenes, to be in this worlde: as contrarie, the other worlde is the place of iuſtice and punishment. Againe in this world we are in continuall warre as holie Iob ſaith. <hi>Militia est vtta hominis ſuper terram.</hi> The life of man vpon earth is a warfare. And for this cauſe we iuſtlie aske for our ſelues peace, but as touching the departed, they are in peace,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:29031:214"/> although they are not in repoſe; for they are in peace with all theire former enimies, the world, the flesh, and the diuel, (for otherwiſe they were not in ſtate of ſaluation:) but they are not as yet in repoſe, but in paynes and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vntill they shall haue fullie ſatisfied for all their ſinnes and offences, for which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne indetted to almightie God: and for this cauſe we do rather wish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repoſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peace.</p>
               <p>And Reſt is therfore added thrice, becauſe there is wished to the ſoules departed a triple or theefould reſt. One from the affliction of paine: an other for the beatifying of the ſoule: and the third for the glorfying both of the ſoule and bodie.</p>

               <p>Finallie, the prayſes of this goſpell can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be ſufficientlie expreſſed, and eſpeciallie where it is ſayd. <hi>Et verbum caro factum eſt &amp; habitauit in nobis.</hi> For reuerence whereof as we daylie ſee, the prieſt falleth downe on his knees, at the pronunciation of the ſayd wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.

If thou wilt doe what I shall tell thee, to wit, that thou wilt reade in my fellowes eare, the goſpel, <hi>In prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio erat verbum,</hi> but yet ſo as I heare not the ſame, knowe for certaine the diuel shall be driuen out of him. But the prieſt vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the craft of the diuel, pronounced the ſaid goſpel out a lowde. And when he ſaid. <hi>Et verbum caro factum est &amp;c.</hi> preſentlie the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:29031:231"/> euil ſpirits flew from them, and both were diſpoſeſſed and deliuered of the diuel.</p>
               <p>It is alſo declared, that the diuel him ſelf ſaid vnto a certaine holie man, that there was a certaine worde of the goſpell, verie dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the diuels. Who asking what that word was, the diuel would not tell. When the holie man had recited diuers authorities, the diuel anſwered to euery one, that it was not that. At the laſt being asked if it were that, <hi>Verbum caro factum eſt.</hi> He anſwered not, but with fearfull cryinge foorthwith vanished.</p>
               <p>For concluſion (gentle Reader) I wil cloſe vp this diſcourſe with the wordes of a godlie writer, and not with myne owne, ſaying.

I therfore herein, haue done diligentlie what I could, not ſufficientlie what I would. The onlie recompenſe which for this labour I looke for from men is, that they would vouchaſafe before the mercifull iudge, (who beſt knowes with what intention of hart I wrote this treatiſe) to shed foorth their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout prayers vnto him for my ſinnes.
